# SQL

If we're using a common table expression, we might first test the query
that creates it:
```{python}
cte_query = '''
SELECT
    branch,
    date,
    MAX(unit_price) AS highest_price
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY branch, date
'''
cte_result = pd.read_sql(cte_querycte, con)
```

And if we're happy with the result, we make the query that uses it:
``` python
query = '''
WITH highest AS (
  SELECT
    branch,
    date,
    MAX(unit_price) AS highest_price
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY branch, date
)
SELECT
  sales.*,
  h.highest_price
FROM sales
JOIN highest h
  ON sales.branch = h.branch
    AND sales.date = h.date
'''
pd.read_sql(query, con)

```

But if we want to keep both `cte_query` and `query`, we can avoid
repetition by referring back to `cte_query`:

```python
query = f'''
WITH highest AS (
  {cte_query}
)
SELECT
  sales.*,
  h.highest_price
FROM sales
JOIN highest h
  ON sales.branch = h.branch
    AND sales.date = h.date
'''
pd.read_sql(query, con)

```
